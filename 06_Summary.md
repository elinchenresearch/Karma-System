# 6. Summary

This paper introduced the concept of the **Karma System** as a structural framework to move beyond blame in complex systems.  
It positions Natural, Structural, and Moral karma as overlapping but distinct causal architectures, and argues for system redesign over guilt assignment.  

The final proposal is to treat recognition and redesign of karmic loops as a **collective epistemic duty** â€” a necessary skill for navigating our interconnected world.
