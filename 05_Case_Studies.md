# 5. Case Studies

The Karma System framework can be tested against real-world failures of blame-based responsibility.  
These cases show how loops — not individual intentions — are the drivers of harm.  

# Case Types for Structural Karma Coverage

## Case Types

| Case Type | Example Case | Structural Karma Focus | Why It’s Essential |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------------|--------------------|
| **1. Systemic Actor Distortion** | Annie Dookhan | Incentive loops, distorted output treated as legitimate, systemic absorption of harm | Shows how system misaligns pressure and responsibility |
| **2. Individual Collapse Under Latent Loops** | Shinji Aoba (Kyoto Animation) | Long-term unprocessed loop buildup, invisible karma load, eventual rupture | Illustrates moral weight misattribution and slow-loop harm |
| **3. Predictive AI/System Harm** | COMPAS algorithm, facial recognition bias | Misaligned feedback, scale effects, structural offloading onto populations | Demonstrates technical karma loops and their opacity |
| **4. Symbolic Moral Overload / Martyr Loop** | Whistleblowers, martyr figures | Goodness loops turned harmful via emotional overextension and institutional resistance | Highlights moral karma overload and loop inversion |
| **5. Fictionalization of Harm Loops** | *Handmaid’s Tale* (public reaction) | Historical trauma re-entering loop system as speculative permission or fascination | Explores how cultural signals re-trigger or distort feedback learning |
| **6. Statistical Offload Failure** | Incel violence or school shootings (generalized) | Low-frequency high-impact events ignored by predictive systems; long-loop collapse | Shows the blind spot of data-driven priority logic |
| **7. Art as Loop Rewrite / Illusion** | Popular trauma-centered art | Emotional loop override without feedback recalibration; tension misread as resolved | Allows critique of cultural self-soothing that masks real loop damage |
| **8. Silent Karma Loops from Good Design** | Welfare policy loopholes, NGO interventions | Well-intentioned structures create dependency, feedback suppression, or side effects | Reveals the shadow loops even in progressive systems |

## Why This Case Set Works

| Dimension Covered? | Explanation |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Agent Type (Individual ↔ System)** | ✔ Dookhan, Aoba, incel cases show personal agents; COMPAS, welfare, NGO loops show systemic loops. |
| **Karma Type (Natural ↔ Structural ↔ Moral)** | ✔ Each karma type appears in multiple forms, with cross-interactions (e.g., latent trauma in Aoba = natural → moral → structural). |
| **Visibility (Obvious ↔ Invisible Harm)** | ✔ Immediate failures (Dookhan, AI bias) vs. slow/hidden collapses (Aoba, incel loops, good design failures). |
| **Loop Length (Short ↔ Long Arc)** | ✔ Statistical offloads and martyr loops cover long karmic buildup; art loops show short-term illusion. |
| **Public Misreading Risk** | ✔ *Handmaid’s Tale* and art cases expose misinterpretation loops and cultural co-option. |
| **Domain Breadth (Law, Tech, Culture, Emotion)** | ✔ From justice to predictive systems to cultural processing to emotional overload. |
