## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer on Language and Context

This work is written in **English**, and therefore carries the weight of **Western intellectual traditions**.  
Some terms used here (for example, *‚Äúphilosophy‚Äù* or *‚Äúreligion‚Äù*) do not fully capture the meaning of concepts from non-Western traditions.  

For instance:  
- I do **not** consider Buddhism to be either a ‚Äúreligion‚Äù or a ‚Äúphilosophy‚Äù in the Western sense.  
- However, I use these terms here as a **compromise**, so that English-speaking readers can follow the argument.  

Please read the text with this awareness: the **Context Lattice System** operates across cultural logics, and the terminology used here is a translation choice, not an absolute classification.
